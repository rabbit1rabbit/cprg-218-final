      <h3>Explaining Balatro and my Experience with the Game.</h3>
      <p>Balatro is a poker-inspired rougelike game where players are able to create decks and play poker hands to score points. Scores can be modified by adding special modifications to individual playing cards, upgrading specific poker hands, and joker cards. While the premise of the game seems kind of basic and boring when compared to other deck builder games like Slay the Spire and Monster Train, the simple premise of the game allows for players to quickly engage with the game and its mechanics. If I were to sum up my experience with this game it would be “hypnotic”. From the relaxing and forever looping theme song to the screen violently shaking with the score counter visibly on fire once you hit a million points, everything about this game keeps you glued to the screen. The game is very repayable, with each run your mind will begin to race with all kinds of builds you can make. Starting a run begins with choosing or skipping a blind. A blind is the main type of encounter in the game where a player must score a certain amount of points before proceeding, failing to do so will lead to a game over. Blinds can also be skipped before they are started to gain an extra buff for your next encounter or shop, however, skipping a blind will also force the player to skip a shop which is the primary way for a player to upgrade their deck. In the shop players are able to buy Jokers which can provide a bonus to the score, planet cards that will upgrade specific poker hands, and booster packs which can upgrade specific cards. Personally my favourite deck to build is a “flush five” build where you play 5 of the same card (e.g. a hand 5 spades). After completing/or skipping 2 blinds, players must complete a boss blind. On top of requiring players to score an amount higher than the previous blinds, boss blinds have special rules to them. For example, there can be a boss blind that does give you any points for playing heart cards, or that 1/5 cards you draw will be drawn face down. To win a run, players must defeat 8 boss blinds, after defeating the 8th boss blind, you are given the option to start a new run or to proceed to an endless mode, where you can keep modifying your deck to hit big scores. Winning with a deck will also unlock different card backs that affect your gameplay(e.g. the blue deck will give you an extra hand to play but one less discard than the red deck).Throughout playing the game players will unlock new Joker cards, these Joker cards can be earned through playing specific hands, winning runs with different decks, and more. With all the variation and unlocks from the different types of runs players will complete, it makes the game hard to put down. </p>

      <h3>Why do I recommend this game.</h3>
      <p>Balatro is an incredibly accessible game that allows newcomers to easily grasp the system mechanics of the game. Building your own deck and seeing the score counter catch on fire once you hit 6 digits will always be satisfying to me. The progression system also incentives players to start new runs with different types of decks all leading to a different experience from the last run.</p>
