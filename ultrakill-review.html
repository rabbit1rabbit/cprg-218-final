      <h2>Ultrakill Review</h2>
      <h3>Explaining Ultrakill and my Experience with the Game.</h3>
      <p>Ultrakill is a fast paced first-person shooter game with a heavy emphasis on being “stylish”. In Ultrakill you play as V1, a robot who is fuelled by blood, after an everlasting war between man and machine there are no more humans on earth, so you descend into Hell to kill demons for fuel. Each level requires the player to proceed through a linear level to descend further into Hell. Even though a majority of the levels are linear this does not affect the quality of the levels, each level is meant to be blitz’d through while dancing between your arsenal of weapons. Ultrakill has 5 weapons with each of them having 3 different modes that changes the function of them(for example, the 1st pistol mode right-click action is a standard charge shot while the 2nd mode has the player flip a coin, upon shooting a coin flying through the air the players’ bullets will ricochet and automatically target the nearest enemy). Almost every action the player takes (aside from taking damage and dying) will increase the players score, the score counter will go from D to SSS depending on how well the player is performing. To reach an SSS score players must cycle through their weapons and use them efficiently while you run through the level. Every level contains enemies that aren’t necessarily hard to fight but each of them are weak to different weapons so it is important for players to learn what is good against what monster. Occasionally at the end of levels bosses will appear to stop the player from further descending down the layers of hell, each of these bosses have incredible soundtracks, interesting mechanics, and perfectly integrates what weapon the player has gotten from the previous level. Ultrakill is my favourite FPS game I have ever played, swapping through each weapon and variation while being chased by 20 demons is incredibly satisfying once you’re able to determine the best weapon for your current situation. The game has no aim assist on in the harder difficulty’s which keeps the game very engaging if you are trying to be as fast as possible. Beating a level in a short amount of time while killing every enemy will earn you a P rank, if a player manages to get a P rank in all levels of a stage they unlock a secret boss fight. This secret boss fight heavily incentivized myself to grind out the game to get a P rank on the hardest difficulty, the reveal of the boss and the following fight was one of the most enjoyable gaming experiences I have had.

      <h3>Why I recommend Ultrakill</h3>
        <p>I recommend Ultrakill to anyone who enjoys playing games that allow you to blitz through from the start to the end. The variety of weapons and enemy weaknesses forces the player to constantly swap weapons which keeps the game feeling always fresh. The progression of difficulty is challenging but not overwhelming. The game has multiple accessibility options allowing players of any skill level to play. And to top it all off, the game has an amazing soundtrack.</p>
