      <h3>Explaining Teamfight Tactics and my Experience with the Game.</h3>
      <p>Teamfight Tactics(also known as TFT) is an auto-battler made by Riot Games, the creators of League of Legends. In Teamfight Tactics you and seven other players build an army (consisting of characters from the League of Legends universe) to battle each other, the last player standing is declared the winner. To build an army players must spend gold in the shop to purchase and upgrade units. Each unit has a class and origin (also known as traits), if you mix champions with the same traits into your army they will gain benefits depending on how much units in your army share the same trait. Alongside traits, another way to strengthen your units is to equip them with items. Items are usually found after completing PVE encounters and during item carousel rounds. While the game has a fairly steep learning curve, it is very satisfying to play once you understand the mechanics of the game. TFT is a little over 5 years old, to keep the game feeling fresh, Riot Games rotates out all units with a brand new themed set of units every 4 months. TFT is currently in its 13th set “Into the Arcane”, which is themed around the second season of the Arcane TV show. Every new set of TFT brings a temporary mechanic that makes the game feel different from the previous set, set 13’s mechanic is the “anomaly” which provides a permanent buff to one of your units. TFT has four different game modes, hyper roll, normal/ranked, double up, and tocker’s trials. While these four game modes can be fun, my main focus is the normal/ranked game mode. Since I have been playing the game for over 5 years, I am very familiar with the basic mechanics of the game but even with years of experience learning a new set always feels fresh and is very satisfying when you are able to learn the different compositions. I have not really been a fan of the last few sets but Set 13 has brought me back into the game. The main thing that always brings me into TFT is the new trait web and units every set. Set 13 has a very interesting and engaging trait web this time around and the units compliment the trait web very well. From black rose dominators to scrap artillerists, the compositions this set are fun to flex around. Set 13 has also introduced the new item bench system, previously the item bench was limited to 12 slots which made it difficult to manage when you have multiple consumable items, the new item bench allows players to store as much items on their bench. My main gripe with this set is the ‘anomaly’ set mechanic, I feel like the anomaly can be a deciding factor from going from first or eighth, since the anomaly is random sometimes you can get the anomaly you desire within 5 rolls or 40 rolls. Aside from that, I think this set has been one of the strongest releases as of yet.</p>

      <h3>What I like about Set 13:</h3>

      <h3>Why I recommend Teamfight Tactics</h3>
        <p>TThough TFT has a fairly steep learning curve it is very rewarding to learn. Watching your army demolish the enemies and seeing the 1st place screen is one of the most satisfying feelings I have while playing a competitive video game. Set 13 is a fairly beginner friendly set to get into the game since it was made alongside the release of the second season of Arcane so Riot wanted to make this set as approachable as possible while still keeping it fresh for veteran players. Set 13 has done an incredible job with keeping each game fun and exciting.
